# Serverless To-Do App

A web-based serverless to-do application built entirely on AWS Free Tier services. Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks without managing any servers.

## Project Goal

Create a fully functional, serverless to-do application where users can manage tasks through a web interface. This project demonstrates the use of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB to build scalable, cost-efficient applications.

## AWS Services Used

- **S3** – Host the frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  
- **API Gateway** – Expose RESTful API endpoints for task operations.  
- **AWS Lambda** – Handle backend logic for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
- **DynamoDB** – Store and manage tasks in a serverless NoSQL database.
